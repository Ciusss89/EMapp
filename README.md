## Project for CYBER PHYSICAL SYSTEMS course

Welcome to Energy Meter application. This project implements an APP which
measures the AC Energy Consumption. The system will use a Nucleo64 board which
runs RIOT.

The final doc release is available here (only ita) [Release documentation](./media/ITA_final_documentation.pdf)
Note: Documentation was written for tag v1.0.

### Instructions
1. Setup your system. I'm using fedora so the command that you find are based
   on my distro.
   ```
   $ sudo dnf update
   $ sudo dnf install arm-none-eabi-binutils-cs arm-none-eabi-newlib arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs-c++
   $ sudo dnf install git-core make stlink make patch vim
   ```

2. Checkout of the code:
   ```
   $ mkdir app
   $ cd app
   $ git clone https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT.git
   $ git clone https://github.com/Ciusss89/_riot-os_app.git
   ```

   The app directory should be contain two `RIOT` and  `_riot-os_app` directory,
   setup the code:

   ```
   cd RIOT/
   git checkout <LATEST_RELEASE>
   cd ../_riot-os_app
   git checkout <LATEST_RELEASE>
   ```

### Compile the app and Run

1.  Compile and write the application on the nucleo board:
    ```
    make clean all flash
    ```
2.  The Nucleo board has debug chip on-board. It connectes its virtual COM
    `/dev/ttyACM0` to the SUART2 of the mcu. Open new terminal and start uart
    communication:
    ```
    sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0 --imap lfcrlf
    ```
    Otherwise you can run the command `make term`
3.  Run `help` to see a list of all available commands

### Project Overview

1. Hardware:
> I tested the project with a STM Nucleo64 board and it works obviously with
> others boards supported by Riot.
> Regarding the current probe I used a cheap current transformer (CT) which
> converts the induced current into a tension using burden resistor as
> transconductance amplifier.

2. Option setup:
> All relevant parameter are configurable by Makefile throught CFLAGS
> CT supported: YHDC TA1020, YHDC SCT013-000 

2. Algoirthms:
> The ADC samples a signal plus the DC bias. It collects continuously 12 samples
> for each 20ms and remove the DC bias offset. The data is filtered through
> moving average algorithm.
> There are four thread, the first take care of ADC conversion, the others
> store the realtime measure into two array (current, voltage). Each array
> collects 240 samples of last 60 seconds, last 10minutes, last 60minutes.
> Each array has been implemented as circular buffer.

3. Implementation:

### Examples:
Set debug mode 3 which prints the contents of array, then saves the printed
output into csv file. Check the directory tests or you can take a look at
this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U7BSr7nPFPo_V7PK5NfKe2i75gcsldSk4o3UBebkcwg/edit#gid=716511268)
